# Edu-hack
The purpose of this repository is to build a successful hack for Eduthon - IIIT Lucknow's pan-India Hackathon.
We have tried to build a one-to-one personal tutoring system where student can interact with tutor and get all his doubts solved.
Also, alongside this we have developed a notes-sharing web application.

# Instructions to set up locally

**(1).** Go to the **requirements.txt** file and install all the relevant packages and modules mentioned in it.

**(2).** Navigate to Video/ directory and type **`python manage.py runserver`** in the CLI. 

The following image would make it clearer. ![image](/cli.jpeg)


After this, you can open the web app in your browser(localhost) which would look something like this. ![image](/video.jpeg).
